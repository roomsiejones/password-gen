# password-gen

## Description

The goal of this project was to recreate a password generator utilizing some baseline code.

This can be used to generate a random password based on criteria you wish to include. 

When the user clicks on the 'generate password' button, the user is presented with prompts that ask length of password, inlude lowercase, include uppercase, include numbers, and special characters.

Those types of characters are added to the password pool and one is generated randomly and displayed on the page. 

This would be a great baseline -- however, in the future, some of the prompts could be converted into checkboxes instead of going through all the prompts.

## Process

Started with baseline code and started working on the JavaScript functionality

Started by assigning variable to all things I would be needing

Then went through and added prompts or confirms for anything I wanted the user to answer

Ensured the character pool included anything the user clicked on

Created the function that randomized the password from the character pool

Added some comments in code for readablility.
